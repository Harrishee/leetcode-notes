# Playground

This is a playground for testing out the basic concepts:
- `Quick / Merge Sort`
- `Binary Search`
- `Heapq / Priority Queue`
- `Reverse linked list`
- `Iterative Tree Traversal`
- `Topological Sort`
- `01 Knapsack 2D/1D`

These exercises are best practiced regularly, and you can consolidate them all in the `practice.py` and test them out in the `test.py` file

Note: The testcases are not comprehensive. Better to test them out in Leetcode or other platforms.
